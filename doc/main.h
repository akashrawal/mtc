/**
 * \mainpage
 * 
 * This is MTC, a high performance general purpose 
 * serialization library and distributed object system abstraction.
 * 
 * This project aims for:
 * - Performance. To outperform existing systems is the first goal.
 * - Abstractions only. Distributed object system is an abstraction
 *   so that you can adapt it to different situations.
 * - Simplicity. To help keep things fast the design is kept
 *   as simple as I possibly can.
 * 
 * Serialization and distributed object system are separate. 
 * Serialization is completely self-contained and can be used 
 * straightaway. Distributed object system is built on abstract 
 * message passing interface.
 * 
 * This project is hosted on Github at
